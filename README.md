# LinkScope-Graph-Toolkit
Interactive analysis toolkit for text analytics.  Based on UCSB's WIGIs Framework.

This toolkit is for browser-based analysis of node-link data for text analysis.  Links can be formed in a variety of ways including topic modeling, structure analysis, semantic or syntactical methods.  It is powered by a Java back end and has a custom HTML5-like front end that is scalable to support real-time interactions with graphs of up to millions of interconnected nodes.  This software is useful for exploring any connected network data. The core code has been extended to work with many different applications, from interactive interfaces for recommendation systems like Amazon's, to visualization of semantic web data in Wikis like this one. The software has also been used in intelligence analysis and for visualization of data in biological fields such as gene sequencing which frequently require large scale connectivity analysis.

The code has not be actively maintained since 2014,  For details and questions, please email jod@cs.ucsb.edu
